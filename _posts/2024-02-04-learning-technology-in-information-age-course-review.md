I have recently completed the [Learning Technology in the Information Age](https://www.pluralsight.com/courses/learning-technology-information-age) course on Pluralsight.

Here are some key reflections:

The course revolves around the following topics:
- How to think about learning
- Breakdown learning into core elements
- Put what we have learned in practice

In today's world, time is the true cost of learning and this course provides strategies to learn more in less time.

The course breaks down tech learning into four tracks,

##### 𝐅𝐮𝐧𝐝𝐚𝐦𝐞𝐧𝐭𝐚𝐥𝐬

The Fundamentals Track lays the groundwork for a comprehensive understanding, providing a lasting foundation that endures over time. It delves into the essential basics, potentially complex but essential for building a solid expertise in any field. Think of it as the anchor that keeps your knowledge grounded and resilient.

##### 𝐈𝐧𝐟𝐨𝐫𝐦𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧

The Information Track, while valuable for its specific tech insights, has a shorter shelf life and tends to become obsolete quickly. Staying vigilant and continuously updating your knowledge is crucial in this fast-paced realm to remain at the forefront of technological advancements. 

##### 𝐒𝐤𝐢𝐥𝐥𝐬

The Skills Track is where knowledge transforms into practical action. It's the hands-on application of what you've learned about fundamentals and information. This track is what employers and clients often seek – the ability to translate theoretical knowledge into tangible, real-world solutions. Mastering the Skills Track is like acquiring the tools needed to navigate the professional landscape successfully. It's where your expertise truly comes to life.

##### 𝐈𝐧𝐧𝐨𝐯𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧

The Innovation Track is usually the domain of tech consultants, where expertise meets cutting-edge solutions. These experts lead the way in leveraging advanced technologies, offering visionary insights, and architecting future solutions. In a rapidly evolving tech landscape, the Innovation Track represents a commitment to staying at the forefront of advancements, driving progress, and shaping the future.

In addition to these tracks, the course provides insights into effective learning methods and crafting a robust learning plan, covering key aspects such as:

- Understanding the nature of schools
- Identifying sources for curation
- Locating valuable knowledge hubs
- Finding resources for honing skills
- Seeking support and maintaining discipline
- Navigating avenues for gaining expertise
- Discovering platforms for certification
- Exploring sources for enjoyable learning experiences

Overall, it's a valuable resource that's definitely worth exploring! 📚💻🎓 #TechLearning #ProfessionalDevelopment #Pluralsight
